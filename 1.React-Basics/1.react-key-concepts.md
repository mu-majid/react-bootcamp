### Before React:
  * we had html, css, and js.
  * Each browser had its own implementation, and each js features.
  * jQuery came out and made it easy to deal with DOM manipulation.
  * With websites becoming more interactive and large, js was becoming more used in websites, and backbone.js came out to organize these js files.
  * With jQuery, and backbone.js and Ajax. Now we were able to only load the websites html once and only make the js change the layout or request another file.
  * AngularJS was the defacto SPA in 2010.
