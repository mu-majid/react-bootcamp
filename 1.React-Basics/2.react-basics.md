### React JS v. Browser:
  * The version of the js used in react is far more advanced than the one used inside most of our browsers.
  * For this we have babel and webpack that takes react js and convert it to what a browser could understand.
  * `create-react-app` helps with amount of configuration needed to start react project. It simply hides babel and webpack configuration.
  * babel makes sure the js in our app is understood by all the browsers.
  * Webpack is all about bundling the js files into one file.

### Class v. Function Components:

  * In class components we get access to the `state` object.
  * Functional components could have state by using new hooks api. (useEffect, useState)
  * `setState()` is what is used to change a state in a react components. This ensures the unidirectional data flow in the virtualDOM, causing react to call the render function for the components affected by such a change and send these updates to the actual dom.
  * Remember to call `super` in the component's constructor to get all the functionality of react component.

### List Of JSX elements:

  * Don't forget to add the `key` property on each JSX element that is in a list.
  * React uses this `key` to determine which element to change if one of these elements has a value that changes.

### Lifecycle methods:

  * Methods that gets called in different stages of the component's life.
  * Mounting a component means, that react rendered it for the **first** time.
