### React JS v. Browser:
  * The version of the js used in react is far more advanced than the one used inside most of our browsers.
  * For this we have babel and webpack that takes react js and convert it to what a browser could understand.
  * `create-react-app` helps with amount of configuration needed to start react project. It simply hides babel and webpack configuration.
  * babel makes sure the js in our app is understood by all the browsers.
  * Webpack is all about bundling the js files into one file.
