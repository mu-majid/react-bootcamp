## Project's Notes:

  * A page is a component that is not going to be used more than once, but a component is a reusable one.
  * Our files structure will account for that difference by having two folders, onr for components and the other for pages.

  * For having a background image that scales on hover:
    - [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35939859/how-do-i-animate-background-image-size-on-hover-smoothly-in-css)
    - [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/zooming-background-images/)

    - The key takeaway: Always wrap the div with bg-img inside a wrapper, and give that div a height and width of 100%.

### Routing In React:

  *Showing a specific page based on what URL in address bar*

  * Browsers are built around the idea of clicking a link and getting an HTML page with resources (js and css) for that page.
  * React on the other hand is built around javascript manipulating the DOM. And there is no extra pages fetching.
  * A major problem with SPA was the back button in browsers, as mentioned above, SPA libraries and frameworks did not have the idea of links.
  * But this was solved when the browsers introduced the History API, it is what React uses to hijack or mimic urls.

  * Using the `react-router-dom` library is considered a standard right now.
  * And the most used type of routers is `BrowserRouter`:
  ```javascript
  // Wrap the App with the router
  ReactDOM.render(
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );

  // Then inside the App:
  function APP () {
    return (<div>
      <Route exact path="/" component={Homepage} />
      <Route exact path="pageOne" component={pageOneComponent} />
      <Route exact path="pageTwo" component={pageTwoComponent}/>
    </div>)
  }

  // Another Component worth mentioning is the `Switch` component
  // And is used by wrapping Route components.
  // The <Switch /> component will only render the first route that matches/includes the path. Once it finds the first route that matches the path, it will not look for any other matches. Not only that, it allows for nested routes to work properly, which is something that <Router /> will not be able to handle.
  function APP () {
    return (<div>
    <Switch>
    <!-- exact now is only used on the root "/" route -->
      <Route exact path="/" component={Homepage} /> 
      <Route path="pageOne" component={pageOneComponent} />
      <Route path="pageTwo" component={pageTwoComponent}/>
    </Switch>
    </div>)
  }
  ```

  * when a component is rendered by `<Route>` component, three props are passed along with the props object of the component rendered.
  * These three attributes are: 
    - `match`: contains the `url` matched and caused the component to be rendered. And any url parameters. `url` is used for building dynamic routing with <Link> component (match.url + someId)
    - `location`: tells us where we are now, using `pathname` property.
    - `history`: the main thing here to focus on is `push`, this push is used instead of (and equivalent to) the <Link> component.

  * When navigating we use `<Link>` react-router component or history.push as mentioned above.
  ``` xml
  <Link to="/another-resource">Click Here</Link>
  ```
  The idea here is that we're not re-rendering the app, but manipulating the DOM to hide and show components based on the url.
  * if an anchor tag is used, this would cause the entire app to re-render. 

  * There is a **BAD PRACTICE** called *prop tunneling/drilling*, which means passing props from parent to children deep in the tree.
  * This could occur when passing `history` object from a Homepage down to Directory, then to MenuItems components (like in our app)
      ```text
      <Homepage> Rendered when "/" is visited => pass the history,location,match down to <Directory> => pass them again down to <MenuItem>
      ```
  * A solution to this is using `withRouter()` HOC. that gives us access to history, location, and match objects.

  * Pay close attention to anonymous function calls like `map`, `filter`,...etc. inside our apps, because they are run every time the components gets rendered.

### Authentication:

  * In this App, Firebase was used for storing data(firestore), and also their authentication server, that allows Oauth (like sign in with google) and regular email/password login.

  * The main pattern used in authentication in the app is event based. Whether we login (w/ email/password or google) or sign up, we subscribed to firebase `onAuthChange` method to send us back any change in the app's  `componentDidMount` lifecycle method.

  * Firebase keeps auth users in their auth server, but we need to save them in our datastore (firestore). So there is a function called `createUserProfileDocument` that checks if the user causing the event to be triggered (login/signup) is in our DB or not (if not save him).

  * We rely on firebase's user session persistence.

### Redux Introduction:

  * Redux introduces the idea of a store that holds all the attributes we need across all our components. Instead of making state local we globalize it in a store and these attributes gets passed down to components from the store as props by connecting the component to the store.

  * check this [article](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react) to avoid some misconception about redux.

  * Concepts of Redux:
    - Redux solves the issue when state gets really complicated.
    - Useful for sharing data between components.
    - Predictable state management using three principles:
      1. Single source of truth (store)
      2. State is read only (immutable object)
      3. Changes using pure functions (for some input, we guarantee the output is predicted).

  * Redux flow could be summarized as follows: Action(s) => Root Reducer => Store => DOM changes.

  * Redux uses architectural pattern called [**Flux Pattern**](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview/#:~:text=Flux%20is%20the%20application%20architecture,a%20lot%20of%20new%20code.).

  * **Why use redux?** -Ans. To get a better understanding, when we look at our app at [this commit](https://github.com/mu-majid/react-bootcamp/commit/866ad654f8d11b9409e53193ddfeece27027a8b7), If we need the currentUser state to be in a Cart component that will be inside the Header component, we will be drilling the currentUser state from the App -> Header -> Cart.

  * Actions are objects that gets send from Components to reducers, and update the state that in turn updates the components connected to that piece of state.

  ![action](./imgs/action.png)

  * Reducers are just functions that gets all dispatched actions, and each reducer determines whether it is concerned about an action or not by utilizing a Switch Statement to check on the action `type`.

  * Also remember to return a new object when updating state from reducers. New objects means new memory addresses which means the state changed and causes re-render.

  * Another piece in redux flow, is `Middleware`, which gets fired before the action reaching the reducer.

  * React Redux selectors are functions that pull out some piece of a state from the store and aggregates/uses it to show some information inside a react component. An example is showing the count of items inside a shopping cart on the cart icon, this uses the count or the quantity of all items in cart to show the number.

  * An issue with this selector, is that it re-renders the component it is being used in as every time redux reducers return a new object, and `mapStateToProps` inside the component gets called even if the changed state is not used in the selector.

  * A solution for this issue is to memoize the value that the selector operate on. and to do so there is a library called `reselect`.

  * Components `cart-dropdown` and `cart-icon` use this memoized redux selectors, so that they don't get re-rendered when unrelated state (anything except cartItems state) changes.

  * The take away here is that redux's `mapStateToProps` has a shallow equality check for every value in the object; it won't replace values if they pass a shallow equality check which means it won't needlessly re-render, but if we have transformation (like reducing items to a single count number) logic it's still valuable to memoize it with a selector to save us running duplicate logic to get the same output.

  * connect function passes the `dispatch` function as a prop to the connected component if mapDispatchToProps is not specified.

### Session Storage and Persistence:

  * Remember our user status is handled by firebase, so right now the logged in user session persistence is not handled by our application.

  * If the user reloads the page, he/she would lose all the app's state (like cart Items).

  * `redux-persist` is a library that uses local storage to store the current state of an app.

  * Session storage stores data during a session (an opened tab), and local storage stores data until we clear it.
